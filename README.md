House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting house prices using basic machine learning techniques in Python.
It is designed to be easy to understand, especially for beginners learning data science and ML.

Project Overview

Project Overview

Built a house price prediction system using Python and machine learning.

Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand feature relationships.

Handled missing values and applied feature scaling & encoding.

Trained a Linear Regression model using scikit-learn.

Evaluated the model using RMSE, MAE, and R² score.

Visualized results with actual vs predicted price plots.

Saved the trained model for future use or deployment.
